A protective box providing an additional protection layer for healthcare provider while intubating a patient or performing other procedures. Other PPEs such as glasses, masks and face shields are necessary -- the box is only an additional physical barrier.

The box design is based on Dr. Yung-Laiâ€™s Aerosol Box (https://sites.google.com/view/aerosolbox/design) and a slanted design by EverythingAcrylic in Philippines (https://www.facebook.com/everythingacrylic.ph/). Currently we are prototyping and testing a v.1.2 design with Santaros Klinikos in Vilnius, Lithuania. The main changes from the original Dr. Yung-Lai's design, based on feedback from an ICU doctor:

 * Slanted top, providing better access and visibility to the doctor
 * The box is wider and longer
 * The bottom and top corners are rounded (CNC milled from polycarbonate or other durable plastic), meaning there are fewer sharp corners and it is easier to clean.
 * The hand holes are larger and elliptical

v.1.2 is still in production as of March 29th 2020, this is a preliminary design. Use at your own risk.

v.1.1 (https://github.com/Technariumas/AerosolBox/blob/master/AerosolBox-slanted-5mm.dxf) features a slanted top, glued from several separate pieces of 5mm acrylic. The box would be more rigid if the sides are made from 8mm thick sheet.
